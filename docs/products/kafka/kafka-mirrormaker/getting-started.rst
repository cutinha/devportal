Getting started
===============

Aiven services are managed in the Aiven `web console <https://console.aiven.io/>`__ . When you first log into the console with your email address and password, you will see the **Services** view, which shows you all the services in the currently selected project.

.. Warning::

    Aiven for Apache Kafka速 MirrorMaker 2 services can be created only alongside at least one existing Aiven for Apache Kafka running service.
    If your project doesn't contain any Aiven for Apache Kafka services, create one before attempting to create an Aiven for Apache Kafka MirrorMaker 2 service.
