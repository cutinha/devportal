Prevent full disks
===================

To prevent **Aiven for Apache KafkaÂ®** from malfunctioning, the Aiven platform detects when the available disk space in **Aiven for Apache Kafka** services is running low, and when the usage exceeds 90% notifies the customer.

If any of the nodes in the service exceeds the critical threshold of disk usage (more than 97%), the access control list (ACL) used to authorize API requests by Apache Kafka clients is updated on all nodes to prevent operations that would increase disk usage. Such operations include:

- ``Write`` and ``IdempotentWrite`` operations that clients use to produce new messages

- ``CreateTopics`` operation that creates one or more topics, each carrying some overhead on disk

When there is not enough space available on the disk and the ACL blocks write operations, clients will see an error. For example, Python client for Apache Kafka will return::

   TopicAuthorizationFailedError: [Error 29] TopicAuthorizationFailedError: you-topic


To ensure that enough disk space is available, you can take one of the following actions:

Upgrade to a larger service plan
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Log in to the `Aiven web console <https://console.aiven.io/>`_ and select your service.

#. On the *Overview* page, scroll down to *Service plan* and click **Upgrade plan** .

#. Select your new service plan and click **Upgrade** .


This launches new nodes with more disk space. Once data is moved from the old nodes to the new ones, disk usage returns to an acceptable level and the ACL is updated to allow write operations again.

You can also use the CLI command :ref:`avn-cli-service-update` to upgrade your service plan.

Add additional storage space
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Follow the steps from our article on :doc:`how to add additional storage to your services </docs/platform/howto/add-storage-space>`.

Delete one or more topics
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Log in to the `Aiven web console <https://console.aiven.io/>`__ and select your service.

#. Click the **Topics** tab.

#. Click **Actions** > **Remove** for any topics that you no longer need.

#. Click **Remove** to confirm that you want to delete the topic.

This deletes the entire topic and frees up the used disk space. It may take up to a few minutes before the log cleaner starts removing the data files from disk. After that, the ACL is updated to allow write operations again.

You can also use the CLI command :ref:`avn-cli-delete-topic` or make a call to `API endpoint <https://api.aiven.io/doc/#operation/ServiceKafkaTopicDelete>`_ from any native Apache Kafka client to delete topics.

.. note:: You must use an admin-level user account for the connection.

Decrease retention time/size
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Another way to make more space available without deleting an entire
topic is to reduce the retention time or size for one or more topics. If
you know how old the oldest messages are in a topic, you can lower the
retention time for the topic to make more space available. Follow the instructions :doc:`to change retention period </docs/products/kafka/howto/change-retention-period>`.
