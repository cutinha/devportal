Creating an Apache Kafka速 topic
===============================

While you can set Apache Kafka速 to :doc:`automatically create a topic when the a message is produced to a topic that does not exist <create-topics-automatically>`, creating topics beforehand is generally considered a preferred practice and recommended for production environments:

* it lets you to define granular topic settings such as the number of partitions, the replication factor, the retention period and more.
* It prevents the wrong topic being generated (for instance with typos).

-----------------------------------------------

To create a new topic via the `Aiven Console <https://console.aiven.io/>`_:

1. On the **Services** page, click on the Aiven for Apache Kafka速 service where you want to crate the topic.

2. Select the **Topics** tab:

   a. In the *Add new topic* section, enter a name for your topic.

   b. In the **Advanced configuration** you can set the replication factor, number of partitions and other advanced settings. These can be modified later.

3. Click **Add Topic** on the right hand side of the console.

   The new topic will be visible immediately, but may take a few minutes before you can update its settings.
