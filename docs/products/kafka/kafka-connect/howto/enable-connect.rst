Enable Apache Kafka速 Connect on Aiven for Apache Kafka速
=======================================================

To enable Apache Kafka速 Connect on Aiven for Apache Kafka速 services, those should be running on business or premium plans.

.. Warning::

    Creating a :ref:`dedicated Aiven for Apache Kafka Connect service <apache_kafka_connect_dedicated_cluster>` is Aiven's suggested option. Having Kafka Connect running on the same nodes as Apache Kafka increases the load on the nodes possibly making the cluster more unstable. 
    
    For a better separation of concerns, a dedicated Aiven for Apache Kafka Connect cluster is therefore suggested.
