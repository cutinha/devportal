Estimate maximum number of connection
=====================================

The number of simultaneous connections in Aiven for Redisâ„¢* depends on the total available memory on the server.

You can use the following to estimate:

.. math::

   {max\_number\_of\_connections} = 4\times m

where ``m`` represents the memory in megabytes. With at least 10,000 connections available, even on the smallest servers. For example, on a server with 4GB memory (4,096 MB), the simultaneous connections are:

.. math::

    4\times 4096 = 16384 {\ connections}

.. note::
    
    Make sure to convert the memory figure ``m`` to megabytes.
