Create additional MySQL® databases
==================================

Once you've created your Aiven for MySQL® service, you can add additional databases, whether for security purposes or to isolate your data per application.

To create a new MySQL® database:

1. In the `Aiven Console <https://console.aiven.io/>`_, on the **Services** page, click on the Aiven for MySQL service name for which you want to create a new database.

2. Select the **Databases** tab:

   a. Enter a name for your database.

3. Click **Add database** on the right hand side of the console.

   The new database will be visible immediately.

.. Tip::

   You can also use the :ref:`Aiven client <avn-service-database-create>` or the :doc:`MySQL client<connect-from-cli>` to create your database  from the CLI.
