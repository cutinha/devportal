Scaling services
================

When creating a new Aiven service, you are not tied to a plan. Your services can be adjusted to better match your needs. Services can be moved to a higher or lower plan, and to a different tierâ€”Startup, Business or Premium.


1. Go to your **Services**, and open the service you want to scale.
2. On the **Overview** tab, scroll down to **Change Plan**. 
3. Select the new service plan and new tier, if required.
4. Click **Change**.

Your service will be in a *Rebuilding* state, and once complete will be on the new plan. The service will still be accessible through the process. 


You can also use the :ref:`dedicated service update function <avn-cli-service-update>` to scale your service plan via the :doc:`Aiven CLI </docs/tools/cli>`.
