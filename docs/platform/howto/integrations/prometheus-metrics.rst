Use Prometheus with Aiven
=========================

Prometheus is an open-source systems monitoring and alerting toolkit. It
implements an in-memory and persistent storage model for metrics as well as
a query language for accessing the metrics.

The metrics delivery model of Prometheus is a pull model where the Prometheus
server connects to HTTP servers running on the nodes being monitored and pulls
the metrics from them. While this makes the service discovery more of an
challenge than using the more common push approach, it does have the benefit of
making the metrics available not just for Prometheus but for any app that can
read the Prometheus format from the HTTP server running on Aiven nodes.

Enable Prometheus support on your Aiven project
-----------------------------------------------

Aiven offers Prometheus endpoints for your services. To enable this feature,
follow the steps below:

#. | Navigate to the project ``Service Integrations`` section from the
     side menu

#. | Add a ``Prometheus`` integration endpoint if one does not already
     exist.

   | Usually you only need one of these per project (as it can be used
     for all services in the same project) so if you can see one has
     already been created then you can skip this step.

#. | Navigate to your service that you
     would like to monitor and click ``Manage integrations``

#. | Choose the ``Prometheus`` service integration by clicking
     ``Use integration``

#. | Confirm you have selected the Prometheus endpoint configured
     earlier in step 2 and click ``Enable``

      :alt: Dialog box to select already configured Prometheus endpoints

#. | Check the service overview page to see that the integration has
     been successfully enabled and is now ``Active``

#. | Copy the Prometheus connection information found from the top of
     the service overview page under the new ``Prometheus`` tab

At this point, the system will start an HTTP server on all nodes of the service
that provide access to the metrics. Note that there can be roughly one minute
delay until the metrics are available.

Accessing Prometheus in a VPC
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

If you use a VPC in your projects, then the property
``public_access.prometheus`` needs to be enabled in the **Advanced
Configuration** of the service whose metrics you want to access.

Configure Prometheus
--------------------

Now that Aiven is exposing endpoints for your services, add a scrape
configuration to Prometheus for the servers you want to pull data from. The
examples in this section show how to configure for both single-node and
multiple-node services.

For services with a single node
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

For single-node services, configure a ``scrape_config`` entry and the following settings:

* Basic auth details can be found on the **Prometheus** tab of the **Service Overview** page.

* The **Service URI** can also be found on the **Prometheus** tab of the **Service Overview** page.

* The location of the CA cert; the certificates are signed by the Aiven project CA so you will need to download it from the **Service Overview** page.

.. note::

    You can download the CA certificate using the 
    `Aiven command line client <https://github.com/aiven/aiven-client/>`_
    and the command ``avn project ca-get --target-filepath ca.pem``

Your ``scrape_config`` job entry in ``prometheus.yml`` would look something like this::

   scrape_configs:
     - job_name: aivenmetrics
       scheme: https
       basic_auth:
         username: <PROMETHEUS_USERNAME>
         password: <PROMETHEUS_PASSWORD>
       tls_config:
         ca_file: ca.pem
       static_configs:
         - targets: ["<PROMETHEUS_SERVICE_URI>:<PROMETHEUS_SERVICE_PORT"]

With the configuration in place, Prometheus will start pulling metrics from your services.


For services with multiple nodes
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

For any services that consist of multiple nodes without a DNS name for each
node, use the ``dns_sd_configs`` option to define the servers with DNS type set
to ``A`` . This causes Prometheus to resolve all the IP addresses associated
with the DNS name and query all of those IP addresses directly. A side effect
of using this IP resolution is that Prometheus expects the TLS certificate to
be bound to the IP address of the hosts, not to the DNS name, so to make the
connection work you must enable the ``insecure_skip_verify`` setting. See the
below snippet for an example configuration.

::

   scrape_configs:
     - job_name: aivenmetrics
       scheme: https
       basic_auth:
         username: <PROMETHEUS_USERNAME>
         password: <PROMETHEUS_PASSWORD>
       dns_sd_configs:
         - names:
             - <PROMETHEUS_SERVICE_URI>
           type: A
           port: <PROMETHEUS_SERVICE_PORT>
       tls_config:
         insecure_skip_verify: true



View full list of metrics
''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Aiven provides the Prometheus client via the Telegraf plugin so all the same
metrics that are available via the Aiven for InfluxDB® metrics integration are also
available via the Prometheus integration. You can see the full list of metrics `here
<https://help.aiven.io/en/articles/5144867-aiven-service-metrics>`_.

.. note:: Note that for some services the metrics provided by different hosts may vary depending on the host role. Most notably for Kafka® only one of the nodes provides metrics related to consumer group offsets.
