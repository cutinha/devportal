  # means allowing `'s` and allowing a plural form. The default dictionary
  # seems to allow `influxDB` as if it were `influx` (it doesn't recognise
  # `influxdb`). However, since we don't expect to need the word `influx`
  # in our texts, let's "correct" it here to InfluxDB.

  # QUESTION: How much do we want to expand this list?

  # Apache Kafka MirrorMaker 2
  # MirrorMaker should always be followed by one (white)space character and a 2

  # Do I want to try to catch "MirrorMaker 2Â®"? This appears at first attempt
