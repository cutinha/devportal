  # The word 'influx' is in the default Vale dictionary, marked /MS, which
  # means allowing `'s` and allowing a plural form. The default dictionary
  # seems to allow `influxDB` as if it were `influx` (it doesn't recognise
  # `influxdb`). However, since we don't expect to need the word `influx`
  # in our texts, let's "correct" it here to InfluxDB.
