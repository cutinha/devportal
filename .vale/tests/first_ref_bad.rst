This is the first non-title reference to Flink.

This is the second non-title reference to Flink.

We also reference Kafka once, and say ClickHouse and then again ClickHouse.

Other registered names: Cassandra, OpenSearch, PostgreSQL, InfluxDB, Grafana, Kubernetes.

There's something wrong about Redis*™, Redis™ and Redis*.

Flink®wahooness and Redis™*blibble are just odd.
