This is a Flink® title
======================

This is the first non-title reference to Flink.

This is the second non-title reference to Flink.

We also reference Kafka® once, and say ClickHouse® and then again ClickHouse.

Other registered names: Cassandra®, OpenSearch®, PostgreSQL®, InfluxDB®, Grafana®, Kubernetes®.

And Redis™* is trademarked and needs an asterisk. But the second Redis does not.

Flink®wahooness and Redis™*blibble are just odd.

Flink®ability and Redis™*ability are just odd but have a second part that *is* a known word.
